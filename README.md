# Data Team Python Wrappers
Some modules to simplify data analysis processes at Gale.

### **Included Solutions**
1. Domo Connector (domo_meido)
2. Environment Manager (envy)
3. AWS Redshift (redshift)
4. SFTP (auto_sftp)

### **Experimental Modules**
1. Data Controller (data_controller)

## Remarks
**Goals**: of this repository is to provide a framework to throttle data analysis processed by reducing the learning threshold required to code. 

To this effect, almost all of the modules featured in this repository utilize environment semantics. Using an environment framework simplifies reproducability by enabling the user to save and load configurations, thereby simplifying setup and teardown.
